    "description": "My name is Juan and I'm a Front End Web Developer. I fell in love with code back in college and decided to pursue it as a career. On my spare time I like be active on CodePen while jamming on some Queens of the Stone Age, showcasing my skills and sharing my work with other developers. Having my work seen and liked by people all over the world is my motivation to continue learning."
